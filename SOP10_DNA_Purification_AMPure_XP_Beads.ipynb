        "\n",
        "1. **Before beginning:**\n",
        "  * Thaw DNA product on ice if the sample was stored at −20°C.\n",
        "  * Prepare 70% ethanol by diluting 100% ethanol in water.\n",
        "  * Shake the bottle of AMPure XP beads to ensure all magnetic particles are resuspended and evenly distributed.\n",
        "  \n",
        "  *Notes:*\n",
        "  Do not vortex the bead, as this could reduce the efficiency of DNA binding.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Procedure:**\n",
        "  * Add AMPure XP Beads to the sample in a 1:1 or 1.8:1 ratio. Thoroughly mix by pipetting up and down 10 times.  DO NOT vortex.\n",
        "  * Incubate for 5 minutes at RT to allow DNA fragments > 100 bp to bind to the beads.\n",
        "  * Place the sample on the magnet plate for 2 minutes at RT or until the solution clears.\n",
        "  * Carefully aspirate the cleared supernatant without disturbing the bead ring. Leave about 5 µL supernatant to prevent accidental removal of beads.\n",
        "  * Add 200 µL freshly prepared 70% ethanol to each sample and incubate for 30 seconds at RT.\n",
        "  * Aspirate the ethanol.\n",
        "  * Repeat the ethanol wash step to ensure contaminants are removed.\n",
        "  * Allow beads to air dry for 5 minutes or until all ethanol has evaporated. Monitor closely to prevent overdrying, especially for fragments >10 kb (overdrying can cause beads to crack, reducing elution efficiency).\n",
        "  * Remove the sample from the magnetic plate.\n",
        "  * Add 40 µL elution buffer to the sample. Thoroughly mix by pipetting up and down 10 times.\n",
        "  * Incubate for 2 minutes at RT.\n",
        "  * Place the sample onto the magnet plate for 1 minute to separate beads from the solution.\n",
        "  * Transfer the clear eluate (DNA) to a new plate/tube.\n",
        "\n",
        "  *Note:* If bead carryover is a concern, transfer the eluate a second time to a fresh plate by repeating the magnetic separation step.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Store the sample at -20°C for long-term storage or used immediately for downstream applications."
