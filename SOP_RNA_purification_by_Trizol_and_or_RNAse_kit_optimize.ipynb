        "\n",
        "### Preparation:\n",
        "  * Pre-setting centrifuges to the appropriate temperatures (4°C and RT).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Sample preparation:\n",
        "  1. Following SOP3, centrifuge the PBMCs at 300 × g for 5 min at RT.\n",
        "  2. Resuspend the cell pellet in ice-cold PBS at a concentration of 7.5 × 10^6 cells/mL. Pipette the cells gently to avoid mechanical stress.\n",
        "  3. Tranfer 1 mL cell suspension to RNAse-free Eppendorf tubes.\n",
        "  4. Centrifuge the cells at 300 × g for 5 min at 4°C.\n",
        "  5. Resuspend the pellet in 1 mL Trizol reagent. Pipette gently\n",
        "  6. Incubate the samples at RT for 5 min to ensures complete lysis of cells and release of RNA into the solution. Mix by flicking gently to ensure even distribution of Trizol without introducing air bubbles, which could lead to RNA shearing.\n",
        "  7. Optional, if the sample has particulate matter (e.g., debris or undissolved components), it can interfere with RNA extraction. Centrifugation at 12,000 × g removes these impurities, leaving a clear supernatant that contains the RNA.\n",
        "How: Carefully transfer the clear supernatant to avoid contaminating it with debris.\n",
        "Sample Storage:\n",
        "\n",
        "Why: If you need to pause, storing the sample at -20°C stabilizes the RNA until you're ready to proceed. This is especially important if you can't complete the protocol immediately.\n",
        "How: Store at -20°C, but avoid repeated freeze-thaw cycles, which can degrade RNA.\n",
        "Notes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Why: Adjusting the Trizol volume to 1 mL if it's less ensures consistent reagent conditions for effective lysis and RNA extraction.\n",
        "How: Simply add more Trizol until the volume reaches 1 mL.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "### Trizol/Chloroform RNA extraction:\n",
        "  1. Add 1/5 volume chloroform to the sample (e.g., 200 µL chloroform to 1 mL Trizol sample). Shake vigorously for 15 s.\n",
        "  2. Incubate the sample for 3 min at RT to allow phase separation.\n",
        "  3. Centrifuge the sample at 12 000 x g for 15 min at 4°C. This step separates the mixture into three distinct layers:\n",
        "  * Upper aqueous layer (RNA-containing) - transparent\n",
        "  * Middle interphase layer (DNA-containing) - white\n",
        "  * Lower organic layer (protein-containing) - pink\n",
        "  4. Carefully transfer the upper aqueous layer to a new RNase-free tube. Avoid transferring any of the lower layers.\n",

        "3. Add 1 volume of 70% ethanol to the purified RNA sample. Mix the solution thoroughly by pipetting up and down several times.\n",
        "4. Add up to 700 µL of the ethanol/RNA mixture to an RNeasy Mini spin column placed in a 2 mL collection tube. Close the lid gently.\n",

        "9. Transfer RNeasy mini column to a new 1.5mL collection tube.\n",
        "10. Add 30 - 50 μL RNase-free water directly onto the membrane. Incubate at RT for 10 min. Close tube gently, and centrifuge at 8,000 x g for 1 min.\n"
