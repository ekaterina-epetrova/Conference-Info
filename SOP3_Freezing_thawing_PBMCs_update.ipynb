        "### **Freezing PBMCs**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Before You Begin**\n",
        "1. Thaw DMSO at RT.\n",
        "2. Prepare freezing medium by mixing RPMI 1640, FBS, and DMSO in the following proportions:\n",
        "    - Calculate the required volumes using the function `freezing_medium(final_volume, fbs_percent, dmso_percent)`.\n",
        "3. Place the isopropanol freezing container at 4°C.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Prepare PBMC Suspension**\n",
        "1. Resuspend PBMCs in the prepared freezing medium to achieve the desired cell concentration (e.g., 10-50 x 10^6 cells/mL).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Aliquot and Store the PBMCs**\n",
        "1. Distribute 1 mL of the PBMC suspension into sterile cryogenic vials.\n",
        "2. Place the vials in the pre-chilled isopropanol freezing container.\n",
        "3. Store at -80°C for at least 24 hours.\n",
        "4. Transfer the cryovials to liquid nitrogen storage (-180°C) for long-term preservation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Thawing PBMCs**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Before You Begin**\n",
        "1. Set the water bath to 37°C.\n",
        "2. Warm up FBS and RPMI 1640 to 37°C.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Thaw Cryovials**\n",
        "1. Quickly transfer cryovial(s) from liquid nitrogen storage to a 37ºC water bath.\n",
        "2. Once a small ice chip remains, remove the cryovial from the water bath and immediately transfer to the biosafety hood.\n",
        "3. Clean the outside of the cryovial with 70% ethanol.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Process the Thawed PBMCs**\n",
        "1. Transfer the thawed PBMCs dropwise into 3 mL of FBS in a 15 mL conical tube.\n",
        "2. Slowly add 12 mL of pre-warmed RPMI 1640 to the cell suspension.\n",
        "3. Centrifuge the cells at 300 x g for 5 minutes at room temperature. Carefully discard the supernatant by pipetting.\n",
        "4. Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 mL of pre-warmed RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **Assess Cell Count and Viability**\n",
        "1. Count the cells using an automated cell counter. Premix 18 ul cell suspension with 2 ul dye.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Expected Results**\n",
        "- PBMCs should be well-preserved after freezing and exhibit high viability (>80%) post-thaw.\n"
